# Todo List Application

A straightforward, command-line Java application for task management, designed to help developers explore practical implementations of core Java concepts. This project highlights dynamic list management and interactive console-based user interfaces.

## 📜 Description

The **Todo List Application** is a simple tool for creating, viewing, managing, and deleting tasks. It serves as a learning resource for developers to practice working with:
- **Java Collections Framework**: Using `ArrayList` for dynamic storage of tasks.
- **Control Flow Statements**: Managing program logic through `while` loops and `switch-case`.
- **Basic Input Handling**: Capturing user input via `Scanner`.

This project is suitable for developers interested in learning or revisiting essential Java programming concepts.

## 🛠 Techniques and Features

### **Core Features:**
1. **Task Management:**
   - Add new tasks to a dynamically growing list.
   - Mark tasks as completed.
   - Delete tasks by task number.
2. **Status Tracking:**
   - Tracks completion status with a `Boolean` for each task.

### **Highlighted Techniques:**
1. **ArrayList for Dynamic Data Management**
   - Uses the `ArrayList` class for storing and managing tasks. [Learn more about ArrayList on MDN](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).
2. **Switch-Case for Interactive Menu**
   - Implements a console-based menu with user-friendly options. [Documentation on switch-case](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html).
3. **Input Handling**
   - Utilizes the `Scanner` class to handle console input efficiently. [More on Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html).

## 🔍 Known Limitations

1. **No Data Persistence:**
   - Tasks are stored in memory and lost when the program terminates. Future versions could include file-based storage.
2. **Command-Line Interface Only:**
   - The application lacks a graphical user interface (GUI).
3. **Error Handling:**
   - Minimal validation for user inputs like invalid task numbers.
